# Custom Linux Settings

This is my setup for terminal navigation on Linux distributions. This includes
terminal dot files for setup as well as vim settings.


## Terminal Setup

This setup uses the z-shell if available adn uses vi key bindings within the
terminal as well. When using z-shell it uses the oh-my-zsh plugin to help
with customization.

These dot files include settings to do the following...
+ Uses the solarized theme
+ Customizes the command prompt

## Vim Settings

Uses the molokai theme.

The vim settings have many customizations and custom syntax hilighting files
for specific file types.
