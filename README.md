# Custom Linux Settings

This is my setup for terminal navigation on Linux distributions. This includes
terminal dot files for setup as well as vim settings.

## Terminal Setup

This setup uses the z-shell if available and uses vi key bindings within the
terminal as well. When using z-shell it uses the oh-my-zsh plugin to help
with customization.

These dot files include settings to do the following...
+ Has Fish Of Paradise Putty Color Scheme
+ Uses Agonizer, a powerline theme for style

## Vim Settings

The vim settings have many customizations and custom syntax hilighting files
for specific file types.
